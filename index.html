            <p class="section-description text-center">
                I’ve been building software and web solutions for clients around the world for over 10 years now. Over the years, I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies and tools — from front-end development to back-end systems — always with a focus on performance, clean code, and user experience.

Alongside development, I’ve also gained strong expertise in digital marketing, including Meta (Facebook) Ads, Google Ads, YouTube campaigns, SEO, and data-driven strategies to help businesses grow online.

Want to get a better idea of what I do? Feel free to check out my online resume and explore some of the projects I’ve worked on over the years.
